# About the Byteball Cashback App

Byteball is a **new generation** of Distributed Ledger Technologies based 
on a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**. The **native cryptocurrency** of the 
Byteball platform are **Bytes**. You can find more details about 
Byteball [here](https://byteball.org/).

Mass adoption of Cryptocurrencies requires wide distribution, 
that's why **99% of all Bytes will be distributed for free.**

One of the distribution methods is the **Cashback program**.
